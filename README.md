# AI-Legal-Governance-Toolkit
Bridging Law and AI. Tools for Legal Compliance and AI Governance



# ⚖️ AI Legal-Tech Analyzer 
**Bridging Jurisprudence and Artificial Intelligence for Global Governance.**

This repository serves as a professional development environment for building a hybrid AI engine capable of analyzing legal documents and ensuring regulatory compliance.

## 🚀 The Vision: "Legal-Tech Analyzer"
The goal of this project is to develop a Python-based tool that leverages **Microsoft Azure AI** to:
1.  **Extract Entities:** Automatically identify parties, dates, and laws in contracts (NLP).
2.  **Risk Assessment:** Detect aggressive or non-compliant clauses using Sentiment Analysis.
3.  **Visual Intelligence:** Convert scanned legal PDFs/images into structured data (OCR/Computer Vision).

## 🛠️ Project Roadmap (Q1 2026)

### Phase 1: Foundations (January)
- [ ] **Azure AI-900 Certification:** Mastering the AI fundamentals required for the engine.
- [ ] **Project Architecture:** Setting up the initial Python environment (`legal_analyzer.py`).
- [ ] **NLP Module:** Researching Entity Recognition for legal terminology.

### Phase 2: Security & Governance (February)
- [ ] **ISC2 CC Certification:** Implementing cybersecurity standards into the AI lifecycle.
- [ ] **NIST AI Risk Management:** Integrating the RMF framework into the code logic.

### Phase 3: Development & Deployment (March)
- [ ] **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):** A working script that scans a PDF and flags high-risk clauses.
- [ ] **GitHub Portfolio:** Finalizing documentation for Big-Tech recruitment (Meta/Amazon).
